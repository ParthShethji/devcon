# Summary

Velodrome Finance is a next-generation AMM that combines the best of Curve, Convex and Uniswap, designed to serve as the liquidity hub for the Superchain. Velodrome NFTs vote on token emissions and receive incentives and fees generated by the protocol.

# Overview

## Chain 

Velodrome is deployed on the Optimism chain, an Ethereum L2 in Stage 1 according to L2BEAT.

> Chain score: M

## Upgradeability

Different permissions in the protocol are owned by a number of Multisigs.  

The _Emergency Council_ (a Multisig) has the permission to _kill_ and _revive_ gauges. Gauges distribute rewards to LPs in the system in weekly periods. The amount of rewards per period is determined through an on-chain voting process among veNFT holders. The killing of a gauge results in the loss of all accumulated yield in the gauge for the current epoch. While this permission is intended to be used only in the case of a _malicious_ gauge, see e.g. the case of [killing the USDM gauge](https://gov.curve.fi/t/the-curve-emergency-dao-has-killed-the-usdm-gauge/2307) on Curve in November 2021, it can potentially also be abused if the permission owner is comprimised. 

The _Undeclared Multisig_, the multisig is not referenced in the docs, has the privilege to (un-) whitelist veNFTs to participate in the gauge rewards voting process during the last hour before an epoch ends. During this window, the whitelisted veNFTs are the only allowed voters and are thus able to control the final vote outcome. This permission thus too enables the permission owners to unilaterally change the accumulated yield in a gauge. 

Furthermore, the `Undeclared Multisig` is assigned the owner role in multiple contracts and in particular in the _FactoryRegistry_ contract. This contract grants the ability to approve or unapprove factories within the Velodrome system. Swaps are then routed through new pools from the approved factories. However, traders are protected from malicious factories (and pools) through a slippage tolerance which is enforced on the router. LPs too are not at risk of supplying liquidity in a malicious pool since only pools from the default factory are enabled for LP functions.

> Upgradeability score: M

## Autonomy

Velodrome does not have external dependencies 🎉

> Autonomy score: L

## Exit Window

Permissions are not protected by an exit window resulting in users not being able to withdraw funds in case of an unwanted update.

> Exit Window score: H

## Accessibility

Velodrome provides several access points to the protocol, both decentralized and centralized. Decentralized links include [velo.drome.eth](https://velo.drome.eth), [velo.drome.eth.limo](https://velo.drome.eth.limo), and [velo.drome.eth.link](https://velo.drome.eth.link), while centralized options include [velodrome.finance](https://velodrome.finance) and [alt.velodrome.finance](https://alt.velodrome.finance). This diversity of user interfaces offers redundancy and reduces risks associated with access issues.

The Router contract (`0xa062aE8A9c5e11aaA026fc2670B0D65cCc8B2858`) checks whether the submitted factory is approved with the function `isPoolFactoryApproved` exposed by the FactoryRegistry. If a factory is approved, the router allows swaps on the pools from this factory. LiquidityManagement (`addLiquidity()` or `removeLiquidity()`) is not affected, as it only allows pools from the original PoolFactory `0xF1046053aa5682b4F9a81b5481394DA16BE5FF5a` | Undeclared Multisig                                         |

| FactoryRegistry                 | setManagedRewardsFactory      | The permission owner can set the managed rewards factory as default for managed positions. This factory is used by the VotingEscrow contract to generate rewards for users that have a managed ve position (veNFT contract looks up the registered ManagedRewardsFactory inside createManagedLockFor). The reward contracts deployed from the ManagedRewardsFactory expose getReward function which could be a malicious implementation (not paying out rewards for managed positions after calling setManagedRewardsFactory with a malicious factory).               | Undeclared Multisig                                         |
